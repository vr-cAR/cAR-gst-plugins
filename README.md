# cAR-gst-plugins
## Custom gstreamer plugins for the cAR
This repo provides two custom video sources and a filter for allowing adding 360 video/kinect data into a gstreamer pipeline.

* **thetauvcsrc**: Captures h264 frames from a Ricoh Theta X1 camera.
* **k4asrc**: Captures depth, IR, or RGB data from a Azure Quest camera.
* **dcolorizer**: Colorizes or decolorizes 16-bit depth data in a representation resistant to compression artifacts


Special thanks to the University of Texas Automata Group for lending their expertise and equipment for development throughout the entire pipeline.
